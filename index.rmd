Welcome to the **Contributor Manual for the [Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan (TALD)](https://timtim1342.github.io/index.html)**!

Here you will find basic instructions for collecting a feature dataset for the Atlas, writing and formatting an accompanying chapter, and creating map visualizations.

The manual also introduces the underlying philosophy of the project and the structure of the data.
