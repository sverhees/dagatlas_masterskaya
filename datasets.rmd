In order to work on the Atlas, you will need access to our [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qN3TpzX-wTxiX2ZX0ZNJ6SledqzLHE5W). If you do not have it already, please write to Chiara or Samira.

You can find a dataset template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ptIOqpr6PMLdMv0QOLShO_bvQMmYz_88q4My7rC9wY0/edit?usp=sharing).

Create a folder for your feature in the [archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rrm0NOH2E7dGMC97TdCFhjg7Y_FrAU3i?usp=sharing) and upload your datatable, even if it is still a work in progress. This makes it easier to discuss any problems or questions you might have.

Below, the function of each column is explained.

Feel free to browse the archive and look at examples of completed feature datasets, for example [Standard of comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EO_EdjBMZb5wXVpF4-ps89tKCY3lZ0Dfo55HP_U6EXY/edit?usp=sharing).


# List of columns

* **id** - unique number for each row = observation in your dataset
* **lang** - language name

* **idiom** - the name of a language variety; descriptive sources provide information on specific dialects or village varieties of languages, and we aim to be as precise as possible about where our information comes from, in order to draw maximally accurate maps
* **type** - specifies whether the idiom is a village variety, a dialect spoken in multiple villages, or a standard language; please use our standard names and type classifications


> ### Idiom name and type
For most sources in our archive, you can find the name and type of the idiom in [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmOaGjd3ri6uA6yKBNobEfRqkPnsO3ljy_DssM2JrqM/edit?usp=sharing) (sheet: template). Alternatively, you can search for the name and type of a certain idiom in [this database](https://sverhees.github.io/master_villages/sample_maps.html). If you cannot find the idiom referenced in your source, please contact Samira. 
See also [Idioms]().

* **genlang_point** - for each language we need one general value which can be used to color datapoints for which we have no data. If you have multiple idioms and sources for one language, select the most representative or reliable data and set it to *yes* (one per language), and set everything else to *no*; see also [Philosophy - Current approach](https://sverhees.github.io/dagatlas_masterskaya/philosophy.html#Current_approach).
* **map** - in some cases there are multiple observations for one idiom. On the map we can show only one value per datapoint, so you can use this column to set information you want to see on the map to *yes* and everything else to *no*


* **feature** - the name of your feature / chapter
* **value** - the relevant values of the feature (e.g. attested / not attested)

> Maps will be generated based on the **value** column. If you want to show the distribution of multiple parameters, please name your columns **value1**, **value2**, etc.

* **source** - reference to the source you consulted (see [Literature references](#literature-references) below)
* **page** - relevant page in the source
* **comment** - in this column you can "pour out your soul" in the words of G.A. Moroz: add any kind of thought on an observation, its source, etc.
* **contributor** - your name in English, so we know who did what and how to properly credit their work

* **form** - if your feature is [Affective Case](https://timtim1342.github.io/affective.html) for example, with a value attested / not attested, it might be informative to include the suffixes for different languages
* **example_as_in_source** -  an example of how the form is used (if applicable)
* **example** - example in Caucasiologist transcription with morpheme boundaries
* **translation_as_in_source** - original translation of the example
* **translation** - your own English translation of the example
* **gloss** - glosses for the example. Please follow the [Leipzig glossing rules](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/Glossing-Rules.pdf) where possible. This includes unifying glosses from the original sources if necessary
* **gloss_source** - glosses as in the original source, in case they are present
* **example_source** - reference to the source of the example
* **example_page** - page reference for the example
* **example_comment** - any kind of comment you would like to add regarding the example

# Transcription

Please cite forms and examples as they are shown in the original sources, and add a Caucasiologist transcription in a separate column. Caucasiologist transcription diverges from IPA in the following cases:

|IPA|Caucasus|
|---|--------|
|ʃ  |š       |
|tʃ |č       |
|tɬ |ƛ       |
|ʐ  |ž       |

Both gemination of consonants and lengthening of vowels are indicated with /ː/. Nasalization is indicated with a tilde, e.g. /ã/.

If you lack certain symbols to render the original transcription, paste a screenshot into the table.

For help transliterating Cyrillic orthography, see [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19KGYuzTTaopf-2opXuaGfDVKiv3kqS2A/view?usp=sharing).


# Examples

1. Enter the example sentence/phrase/word as it is represented in the source (copy it or insert a screenshot) (**example_as_in_source**)
2. Upload the screenshot as an image to a [separate folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10o1MoCECtCGhDcpTRmDH4nJRG1fwgkeH?usp=sharing) in your feature folder in the archive
3. Add Caucasiologist transcription and insert morpheme boundaries (**example**)
4. Enter the translation as in the source (**translation_as_in_source**)
5. If applicable: enter the glosses from the source (**gloss_source**)
6. Add an interlinear translation in English and glosses for your feature of interest. If you want to gloss the whole example, go ahead! :) (**gloss**)
7. Add your own free translation to English if you want; if the source already contains an English translation, copy it here. (**translation**)

# Literature references

Our database of grammars, dictionaries, and other sources used so far can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmOaGjd3ri6uA6yKBNobEfRqkPnsO3ljy_DssM2JrqM/edit?usp=sharing).

And here is the [archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14RBA31Cj1MsFSiV4E_ZqTLGOhI1dUfMD?usp=sharing) where you can find these resources.

When you use a reference for your dataset, check if it is already in the [database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmOaGjd3ri6uA6yKBNobEfRqkPnsO3ljy_DssM2JrqM/edit?usp=sharing). 

If yes: copy the `Bibtexkey` of the reference from the [literature database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmOaGjd3ri6uA6yKBNobEfRqkPnsO3ljy_DssM2JrqM/edit?usp=sharing) to the column **source** in your dataset. 

In case you used multiple sources for one row / observation, separate the IDs with a semicolon (**;**), and do the same with the page numbers in the adjacent column. 

If you refer to multiple page ranges from one source, separate them with a comma. 

If the entire source was relevant, for example because it was a paper devoted to your topic, or because you read the whole grammar and the feature is not mentioned anywhere, indicate NA in the page column.

|source                       |page              |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
|khalilova2009; khalilova2011 |221, 234–239; NA  |

In the example above, pages 221 and 234-239 from `khalilova2009` have relevant information about the feature, while the paper `khalilova2011` was consulted/is relevant in its entirety.


## Adding new literature

If the source is not in the database yet, you will have to add it. 

The literature database is essentially a list of references in [bibtex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) format. The category of the resource (book, paper, etc.) determines which columns are mandatory. You can see an overview of categories (entry types) and their arguments [here](https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types/).

> Russian resources are listed in Cyrillics with a translation in English.

The `Bibtexkey` is constructed as follows:

`khalilova2009`  
surname (Latin script, lower case letters) + year

In case there is already a different resource by the same author and from the same year in the database, add a keyword *following* the year, e.g. `bokarev1949` / `bokarev1949avar`.


Be sure to complete the following steps when adding new sources:

1. Assign a `Bibtexkey` to your source.
2. Enter all the necessary information about the source in the [literature database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmOaGjd3ri6uA6yKBNobEfRqkPnsO3ljy_DssM2JrqM/edit?usp=sharing).
3. Upload a copy of the source to the [archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14RBA31Cj1MsFSiV4E_ZqTLGOhI1dUfMD?usp=sharing).
