Some general principles for transcription:

* nasalization is indicated with a tilde ~
* gemination as well as long vowels are indicated with a lengthmark ː (triangles, not dots)
* mostly IPA, but notable exceptions include: ʃ = š, ts = c, tʃ = č, tɬ, tɬ' = ƛ , ƛ'
* [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KYV1yOettrVlsv2HFqpL_inoGCRmOyzmBoX10Ku4Oio/edit?usp=sharing) you can find a full table of phonemes attested in the languages of our sample, how to transcribe them (**Caucasiologist**), and how they are represented in different sources

> You will notice that there are a few phonemes that lack a Caucasiologist transcription in the table. Please use IPA in these cases for now.
