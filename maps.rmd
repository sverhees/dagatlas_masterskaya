Maps in [TALD](https://timtim1342.github.io/index.html) are generated automatically based on the **value** column. As explained in [Feature datasets](), you can have multiple value columns in order to generate different maps. 

If you want, you can experiment with map visualizations by yourself using the `lingtypology` package for R. You can find a detailed tutorial for the package [here](https://ropensci.github.io/lingtypology/).

The underlying code and data used for the maps in [TALD](https://timtim1342.github.io/index.html) can be viewed in the Github repository for the Atlas.
