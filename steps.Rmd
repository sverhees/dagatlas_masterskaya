On this page you can find a brief step-by-step instruction on how to collect data according to the TALD methodology.

## Step 1 - Create a folder

Make a folder for your feature in [the archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1Rrm0NOH2E7dGMC97TdCFhjg7Y_FrAU3i) and copy [the feature template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ptIOqpr6PMLdMv0QOLShO_bvQMmYz_88q4My7rC9wY0/edit#gid=0) in it.

## Step 2 - Add data

Collect information for each language in the feature template. Fill all required columns (see [Feature datasets > List of columns](https://sverhees.github.io/dagatlas_masterskaya/datasets.html#list-of-columns) for an explanation of the column names).
 
* We collect data from descriptive literature, which you can find in [our library](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/14RBA31Cj1MsFSiV4E_ZqTLGOhI1dUfMD).
  
  + In our [literature database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XmOaGjd3ri6uA6yKBNobEfRqkPnsO3ljy_DssM2JrqM/edit#gid=1077173260) you can find bibliographical information about the source, as well as information on which idioms are represented in the sources (on the sheet **source type and idiom**, columns **idiom** and **type**).
<br>
<br>
      
* If you want to use a source that is not in the library yet:

  + Submit information about the source via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfekbCiSi5TVtJDAWcAzIajkwYyoR8WjRJ1tjkt0QS6kdkIEA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Each source should be assigned a **bibtexkey** -- a unique identifier that allows us to easily cite sources across the Atlas. See [Feature datasets > Literature references > Adding new literature]() on how to construct a key. Be sure to check whether the key is already taken.
  
  + Upload the source to the appropriate folder in [the library](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/14RBA31Cj1MsFSiV4E_ZqTLGOhI1dUfMD). Use the **bibtexkey** as a filename.
      
## Step 3 - Write a chapter

Write an introductory chapter about your feature in `rmarkdown` using our [chapter template](https://github.com/sverhees/dagatlas_masterskaya/blob/main/chapter_template/chapter_template.Rmd). See [Writing a chapter](https://sverhees.github.io/dagatlas_masterskaya/chapters.html) for more detailed guidelines.

## Step 4 - Check your files

By the end of the work, your folder in [the archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1Rrm0NOH2E7dGMC97TdCFhjg7Y_FrAU3i) should contain the following things:

* your feature table, with the name of your feature as filename
* your chapter text (in .rmd format; optionally a draft version in doc format)
* a table with references used in your text, filename: YOURFEATURE_references
* a copy of the [TALD author agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tw-ty-pZglBhW8Ma3PfSit1migXc0vNX1AZE1BCyNio/edit?usp=sharing), filled out and signed

> Don't forget to add the date on which you submit your finished work to us in the **date** column of your feature table!
